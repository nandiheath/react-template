# react-template
A template project for create a React app with my default settings (definitely opinionated) 

## Reason

Everytime creating a React app is cumbersome. 
You will need to set up the react app, install the libraries, adding the linting/pre-commit hooks/ts config etc.
This template should help saving time from these stuff.

## Libraries Selection

### React w/ Typescript

### Redux

### React-router w/ Redux

### Tailwind

### Material UI

### Styled Components

### Eslint/Prettier/Husky

## Development



## TODO
